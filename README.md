This website contains scripts used in our paper but not datasets due to the size limitation of Github. 
For datasets, please refer to files we uploaded to figshare.
The enviroment files (including installation methods, versions, and dependencies) were written in conda_yml folder.


All instructions are provided in the Methods section of the paper, as well as in the README files located in each subdirectory alongside the relevant scripts.


Some information, including Typical install time on a "normal" desktop computer and Demo, is not suitable since this repository is not a software.
