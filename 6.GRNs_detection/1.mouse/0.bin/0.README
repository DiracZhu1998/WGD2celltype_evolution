# Ensembl ID was downloaded from Ensembl Biomart with latest version
# Due to different version of gene ID, all of the genes were converted into Ensembl version
# step 0: remove some lines in Ensembl ID labelling, some genes synonym conflict with other genes' name
# For example Atf7 gene, therefore this kind of gene synonyms were replaced by its Ensembl ID (ignored in replacement)
