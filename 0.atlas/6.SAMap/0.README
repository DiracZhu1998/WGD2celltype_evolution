# This is an iterative process:
# annotation based on iterative clustering => get tree for each individual atlas => perform SAMap => check mapping => refine annotation => next iteration
# use SAMap_run.py to perform SAMap
# the Refined annotation folder contains annotation based on manual annotation
# using extract_important_information.v2.py to extract integrated UMAP, mapping scores, and save the final pkl file

# please contact corresponding authors for SAMap objects, including vertebrate_neurons.pkl and vertebrate_non_neurons.pkl due to limited GitHub and Figshare space
